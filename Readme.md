## DiffusionMagic  Beta
DiffusionMagic is simple to use Stable Diffusion workflows using [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). 
DiffusionMagic focused on the following areas:
- Easy to use
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Modular design, latest best optimizations for speed and memory

## 2K image generation experiment(No upscaler)
Tested with text to image workflow.

` ./start.sh`

## How to install and run on Mac (Not tested)
*Testers needed - If you have MacOS feel free to test and contribute*

#### prerequisites 
- Mac computer with Apple silicon (M1/M2) hardware.
- macOS 12.6 or later (13.0 or later recommended).

Follow the steps to install and run the Diffusion magic on Mac (Apple Silicon M1/M2).
 - Run the following command:
  `chmod +x install-mac.sh`
- Run the  `install-mac.sh` script.
`./install-mac.sh`

## How to switch models
Diffusion magic will change UI based on the model selected.
Follow the steps to switch the models() inpainting,depth to image or instruct pix to pix or any other hugging face stable diffusion model)
- Start the Diffusion Magic app, open the settings tab and change the model
 ![ DiffusionMagic settings page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rupeshs/diffusionmagic/main/docs/images/diffusion_magic%20setting.PNG)
- Save the settings
- Close the app and start using start.bat/start.sh
 ## How to add new model
We can add any Hugging Face stable diffusion model to DiffusionMagic by 
- Adding Hugging Face models  id or local folder path to the configs/stable_diffusion_models.txt file
E.g `https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0`
Here model id is `dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0`
Or we can clone the model use the local folder path as model id.
- Adding locally copied model path to configs/stable_diffusion_models.txt file
